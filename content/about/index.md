# About Me

:checkered_flag: First of all, here is __[my CV](/files/ziyi_liu_cv.pdf)__. 

:checkered_flag: I studied physical natural sciences at University of Cambridge for my BA, mostly associated with [Cavendish Laboratory](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/), and computer science for MEng at Cambridge [Computer Laboratory](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/about). On the physics side, a wide range of topics were covered at school but I am most interested in quantum computing and physical simulations. I tried to read some Quantum Field Theory beyond my degree but never got past the introductory chapter - will try again one day. I am sure. For CS, my main focus is on Machine Learning algorithms and engineering with strong passions in multimodal ML and ML systems.

:checkered_flag: On the __[projects](/projects)__ page, a selection of my past projects are listed, ranging from college physics paper reviews to ML research reports. I share the same urge of starting (many) new projects as many others, but I do believe in the importance of seeing them through start-to-end, so I will not expand on those I am not actively working on or do not intend to finish.

:checkered_flag: I thoroughly enjoy reading for both information and leisure, and I decided to start keeping a __[record of books](https://google.com)__ I have read/am reading with brief summaries and reviews for each. This is a page under construction and it will be constantly (but not necessarily timely) updated. I am always open to new recommendations as well as different opinions!

:checkered_flag: If you have any interesting projects or ideas in (even barely) relevant areas, or you spotted some mistakes on my site, do hit me up at __canamg2000\at\hotmail.com__  , and I am more than happy to talk about them!
